# Scheduler
To set up the scheduler, first a Google Calendar API CLIENT ID and API KEY must be created.

These can be obtained by completing the prerequsistes steps for Google's JavaScript quickstart tutorial, available at the link below.

https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/js

Once these are obtained, go to the directory named SourceCode within cmd, and run this command if you have a version of Python 3 installed:

python -m http.server 8000

...or this command if you have a version of Python 2 installed:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

...however, this project has not been tested using Python 2, so there may be errors if using Python 2. Please try to use the project using a version of Python 3.
